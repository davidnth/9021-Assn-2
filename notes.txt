Check: There is always a non zero difference between commands on both the left and right side. 
If blocks are the same on both sides, there should be an equal difference in steps on both sides.

To check if a diff can be the diff for 2 files:
   Check B1 on left and right files have the same NUMBER of lines and the same lines.
   Before files are given, we can only check if blocks have the same number of lines. 
   With the files, we can check if the blocks have the SAME LINES.
